  uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.4.0
  with:
    project-url: https://github.com/users/USERNAME/projects/DEVELOPMENT_PROJECT_NUMBER
    github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
    # Set custom field to indicate CI failure
```

### Manual Automation Rules

Set up these automation rules in GitHub Projects:

1. **When issue is labeled "bug"**: Move to Development Board ‚Üí "Backlog"
2. **When issue is labeled "enhancement"**: Move to Research Board ‚Üí "Literature Review"
3. **When PR is opened**: Move to Development Board ‚Üí "Code Review"
4. **When PR is merged**: Move to Development Board ‚Üí "Done"
5. **When issue is closed**: Archive item after 30 days
