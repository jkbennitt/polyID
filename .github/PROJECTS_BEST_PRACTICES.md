## Daily Workflow Examples

### 1. Starting Your Day: Project Board Review

**Morning Routine Checklist:**
```markdown
## Daily Project Review (5 minutes)
- [ ] Check [Project Dashboard](.github/PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md) for overnight alerts
- [ ] Review assigned items across all boards
- [ ] Check CI/CD status for any failures
- [ ] Update status of items you're working on
- [ ] Identify blockers or dependencies
```

**Quick Board Scan:**
1. **Research Board**: Check validation status, new literature to review
2. **Development Board**: Review PR status, test failures, new bugs
3. **Release Management**: Check upcoming deadlines, deployment status

### 2. Research Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Starting a new polymer property prediction model

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Literature Review Issue] --> B[Create Research Task]
    B --> C[Literature Phase]
    C --> D[Hypothesis Development]
    D --> E[Model Development] 
    E --> F[Validation Testing]
    F --> G[Performance Analysis]
    G --> H[Documentation]
    H --> I[Publication Prep]
```

**Step-by-step Process:**

1. **Create Literature Review Issue**:
   ```markdown
   Title: Literature Review - Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Polymers
   
   Labels: research:literature, priority:medium
   Project: Research Board
   
   **Research Scope:**
   - Recent GNN advances in molecular prediction
   - Polymer-specific neural architectures
   - Performance benchmarks in chemistry ML
   
   **Deliverables:**
   - [ ] Summary of 15-20 key papers
   - [ ] Gap analysis for current polyID models
   - [ ] Recommendations for model improvements
   
   **Timeline:** 1 week
   **Research Phase:** Literature Review
   ```

2. **Transition to Model Development**:
   - Update Research Phase field: `Literature Review` â†’ `Model Development`
   - Create linked development issues for implementation
   - Set up validation metrics and success criteria

3. **Performance Integration**:
   - Link to performance monitoring issues
   - Set up automated benchmarking
   - Create validation test cases

### 3. Development Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Implementing cache performance improvements

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Performance Issue] --> B[Investigation]
    B --> C[Design Solution]
    C --> D[Implementation]
    D --> E[Testing]
    E --> F[Code Review]
    F --> G[Integration]
    G --> H[Monitoring]
```

**Implementation Process:**

1. **Issue Creation from Performance Alert**:
   ```markdown
   Title: Cache Hit Rate Below 60% - Performance Degradation
   
   Labels: bug, performance, priority:high
   Project: Development Board
   
   **Automated Performance Report:**
   - Current Cache Hit Rate: 45%
   - Target: >60%
   - Performance Impact: 25% slower predictions
   
   **Investigation Steps:**
   - [ ] Review cache implementation in cache_manager.py
   - [ ] Analyze cache eviction patterns

   - [ ] Profile cache key generation
   
   **Success Criteria:**
   - [ ] Cache hit rate >60%
   - [ ] No memory leaks
   - [ ] Performance tests pass
   ```

2. **Development Tracking**:
   - Move through Development Board columns
   - Link to related performance monitoring issues
   - Update custom fields (Component: Performance, Complexity: Medium)

3. **Integration with CI/CD**:
   - Automated testing triggers project updates
   - Performance benchmarks update project status
   - Failed tests create linked issues

   - Label new issues appropriately
   - Route to correct project board
   - Assign to team members or mark for community

2. **Weekly Community Review**:
   - Review community contributions
   - Update "help wanted" issues
   - Recognize contributors
   - Plan mentorship activities

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Project Board Issues

**Issue**: Items not moving between columns automatically
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check automation rules
gh project rule-list PROJECT_NUMBER

# Verify webhook delivery
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/hooks/HOOK_ID/deliveries

# Test automation manually
gh project item-edit PROJECT_NUMBER ITEM_ID --field-id STATUS_FIELD_ID --text "New Status"
```

**Issue**: Performance alerts not creating issues
**Solution**:
```python
# Check performance monitoring integration
from polyid.performance_monitor import get_performance_monitor
monitor = get_performance_monitor()
print(monitor.get_current_metrics())

# Verify GitHub token and permissions
import os
print(os.environ.get('ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT', 'Not set'))
```

**Issue**: Research items stuck in one phase
**Solution**:
- Review research workflow process
- Check if validation criteria are too strict
- Consider breaking large research items into smaller tasks
- Update Research Phase field definitions if needed

### Integration Issues

**Issue**: CI/CD not updating project status
**Solution**:
1. Verify GitHub Actions permissions
2. Check project automation workflow syntax
3. Test project API endpoints manually
4. Review project number references in workflows

**Issue**: PaleoBond-PCP coordination problems
**Solution**:
1. Create explicit communication issues
2. Set up regular sync meetings
3. Use GitHub Discussions for coordination
4. Implement dependency tracking

### Performance Monitoring Issues

**Issue**: False positive performance alerts
**Solution**:
```yaml
# Adjust alert thresholds in performance monitoring
performance_thresholds:
  memory_usage_alert: 85  # Increase from 80
  prediction_time_alert: 6.0  # Increase from 5.0
  cache_hit_rate_alert: 55  # Decrease from 60
  
# Add alert dampening
alert_dampening:
  min_duration: 300  # 5 minutes
  min_occurrences: 3  # Multiple occurrences needed
```

**Issue**: Research metrics not tracking properly
**Solution**:
1. Review custom field definitions
2. Check data entry consistency
3. Automate more metric collection
4. Create data validation rules

## Quick Reference Commands

### GitHub CLI Commands
```bash
# List all projects
gh project list --owner USERNAME

# View project details
