## Attribution
This repository is a fork of the original [PolyID](https://github.com/NREL/polyID) project, adapted for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces with ZeroGPU acceleration. The original PolyID provides a framework for building, training, and predicting polymer properties using graph neural networks.

PolyID<sup>TM</sup> provides a framework for building, training, and predicting polymer properities using graph neural networks. The codes leverages [nfp](https://pypi.org/project/nfp/), for building tensorflow-based message-passing neural networ, and [m2p](https://pypi.org/project/m2p/), for building polymer structures.  The notebooks have been provided that demonstrate how to: (1) build polymer structures from a polymer database and split into a training/validation and test set, (2) train a message passing neural network from using the trainining/validation set, and (3) evaluate the trained network on the test set. These three notebooks follow the methodology used in the forthcoming publication.

2. [Training a message passing neural network](https://github.com/NREL/polyID/blob/master/examples/2_generate_and_train_models.ipynb): `examples/2_generate_and_train_models.ipynb`

Additional notebooks have been provided to provide more examples and capabilities of the PolyID code base.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Local testing (structure validation without GPU)**: Run `python app.py` to validate polymer structures locally without requiring GPU resources.
2. **Space deployment with ZeroGPU hardware selection**: Deploy the application on Hugging Face Spaces using ZeroGPU for efficient hardware acceleration.
3. **Interface testing via web UI**: Test the user interface through the web-based Gradio interface to ensure proper functionality and user experience.
4. **API testing via auto-generated /run/predict endpoint**: Use the following curl command to test the API endpoint:
   ```
   curl -X POST "https://your-space.hf.space/run/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": ["CC(C)C(=O)OCC"]}'
   ```

### Additional Notes on Key Success Criteria
- Successful structure validation without errors during local testing.
- Accurate polymer property predictions with minimal deviation from expected results.
- Proper API responses with correct JSON formatting and timely execution.
- Seamless integration and performance on ZeroGPU hardware during deployment.

## Model Requirements

### Quick Start Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python 3.13 is installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Normal mode: `python app.py`
   - Development mode (auto-mock if models unavailable): `python app.py --dev`
   - Force mock mode for testing: `python app.py --mock`

3. **Access the Interface**: Open the provided URL in your browser to interact with the Gradio interface.

### Dependency Notes

- **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: This version has been updated to remove packages incompatible with Python 3.13 (`rdkit-pypi`, `tensorflow-addons`, `mordred`).
- **Mock Mode**: When models are unavailable or mock mode is forced, the app generates realistic simulated predictions based on SMILES hash for testing purposes.
- **Model Loading**: The app safely attempts to load trained models from `polyid/models/`. If loading fails, it automatically falls back to mock mode.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizes ZeroGPU for efficient deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.
