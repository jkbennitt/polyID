## Overview

PolyIDâ„¢ provides a framework for building, training, and predicting polymer properties using graph neural networks. This Hugging Face Spaces deployment offers an interactive interface for predicting polymer properties from molecular structures.

## Features

- **Real-time Polymer Property Prediction**: Predict glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and other properties
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Leverages message-passing neural networks for molecular representation
- **Domain of Validity Analysis**: Assess prediction reliability and confidence
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Gradio interface for easy polymer analysis

## Technology Stack

This deployment uses **Standard GPU Spaces** for full compatibility with the complete chemistry software stack:

- **Chemistry Processing**: RDKit for molecular fingerprinting and structure analysis
- **Neural Networks**: TensorFlow 2.16+ with NFP (Neural Fingerprint) layers
- **Polymer Structures**: m2p for polymer structure generation and processing
- **Interface**: Gradio 5.48+ for interactive web interface
- **Python**: 3.11 for optimal performance and compatibility

## Usage

1. **Input Polymer Structure**: Enter a SMILES string representing your polymer structure
2. **Select Properties**: Choose which properties to predict (Tg, Tm, etc.)
3. **Get Predictions**: Receive predictions with confidence intervals
4. **Analyze Results**: Review domain of validity analysis for prediction reliability
