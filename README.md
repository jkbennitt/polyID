## Attribution
This repository is a fork of the original [PolyID](https://github.com/NREL/polyID) project, adapted for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces with ZeroGPU acceleration. The original PolyID provides a framework for building, training, and predicting polymer properties using graph neural networks.

PolyID<sup>TM</sup> provides a framework for building, training, and predicting polymer properities using graph neural networks. The codes leverages [nfp](https://pypi.org/project/nfp/), for building tensorflow-based message-passing neural networ, and [m2p](https://pypi.org/project/m2p/), for building polymer structures.  The notebooks have been provided that demonstrate how to: (1) build polymer structures from a polymer database and split into a training/validation and test set, (2) train a message passing neural network from using the trainining/validation set, and (3) evaluate the trained network on the test set. These three notebooks follow the methodology used in the forthcoming publication.

Additional notebooks have been provided to provide more examples and capabilities of the PolyID code base.

```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Local testing (structure validation without GPU)**: Run `python deployment/huggingface/app.py` to validate polymer structures locally without requiring GPU resources.
2. **Space deployment with ZeroGPU hardware selection**: Deploy the application on Hugging Face Spaces using ZeroGPU for efficient hardware acceleration.
3. **Interface testing via web UI**: Test the user interface through the web-based Gradio interface to ensure proper functionality and user experience.
4. **API testing via auto-generated /run/predict endpoint**: Use the following curl command to test the API endpoint:
   ```
   curl -X POST "https://your-space.hf.space/run/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": ["CC(C)C(=O)OCC"]}'
   ```

### Testing Scripts

- **Simple API test**: `python scripts/deployment/test_simple.py`
- **Mock mode test**: `python scripts/deployment/test_mock.py`
- **API endpoint test**: `python scripts/deployment/test_api_endpoint.py`
- **API test**: `python scripts/deployment/test_api.py`

### Additional Notes on Key Success Criteria
- Successful structure validation without errors during local testing.
- Accurate polymer property predictions with minimal deviation from expected results.
- Proper API responses with correct JSON formatting and timely execution.
- Seamless integration and performance on ZeroGPU hardware during deployment.

## Model Requirements

### Quick Start Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python 3.10.13 is installed (required for ZeroGPU), then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Normal mode: `python deployment/huggingface/app.py`
   - Development mode (auto-mock if models unavailable): `python deployment/huggingface/app.py --dev`
   - Force mock mode for testing: `python deployment/huggingface/app.py --mock`

3. **Access the Interface**: Open the provided URL in your browser to interact with the Gradio interface.

### Dependency Notes

- **Python 3.10.13 Compatibility**: This version is optimized for ZeroGPU which requires Python 3.10.13. RDKit and other chemistry packages are configured for this specific Python version.
- **Mock Mode**: When models are unavailable or mock mode is forced, the app generates realistic simulated predictions based on SMILES hash for testing purposes.
- **Model Loading**: The app safely attempts to load trained models from `src/polyid/models/`. If loading fails, it automatically falls back to mock mode.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizes ZeroGPU for efficient deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.
